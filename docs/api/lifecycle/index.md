#Product Lifecycle, version management
##Master Data version
EBMEDS supports only three latest master data versions. During master data publishing process, older versions are automatically removed from master data container.

##EBMEDS version
Only latest major and minor version has official support. Minor or major version updates might contain breaking changes and/or bug fixes for issues that might contain patient safety impact. Therefore SAAS service and all third party installations should use latest major and minor version.

Product lifetime will be defined to be two years from the publishing date for each product version. After this period the product will need to be either updated to a newer version or taken out of use. Additionally, when products are distributed via SaaS model, only latest version is officially supported and available for clients.

##Release Cycle
EBMEDS gets new releases 2-4 times a year. If there are major bugs found, additional maintenance releases may be published. For all releases and installations we use Integration Checklist document. All tasks mentioned in Integration Checklist must be completed to get official support for EBMEDS installation in third party installations.
